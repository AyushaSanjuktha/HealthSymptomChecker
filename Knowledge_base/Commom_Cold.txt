Condition: The Common Cold

Symptoms: A common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat. Symptoms typically include a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, congestion, and sneezing. You may also have a mild fever or feel generally unwell.

Causes: The common cold is caused by many different viruses, but rhinoviruses are the most common cause. The virus spreads through the air from an infected person's cough or sneeze, or by touching contaminated surfaces.

Prevention: To reduce your risk of getting a cold, wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your face (especially your nose, mouth, and eyes), and stay away from people who are sick.

When to see a doctor: A common cold usually clears up on its own. You should consult a doctor if your symptoms are severe, if you have a high fever, or if your symptoms don't improve after 7-10 days.
